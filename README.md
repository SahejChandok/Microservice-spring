# Spring Boot Microservice for CRUD Operations
This Spring Boot microservice is designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, focusing on storing, updating, and fetching data from a MySQL database.

## API Testing
To interact with the API, use the following request body format:

## json
{
    "location": "Mumbai",
    "principalName": "Singh",
    "schoolName": "Podar International"
}

This structure facilitates seamless communication with the microservice, enabling the saving, updating, and retrieval of essential information from the associated database.
